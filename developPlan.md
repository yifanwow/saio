# Two-Week Development Plan for Steam Integration Project

## Week 1: Setup and Basic Integration

### Day 1: Project Setup
- Set up the project repository.
- Create basic project structure (frontend and backend).
- Set up version control with Git and GitHub.

### Day 2: Research and Design
- Deep dive into Steam Web API documentation.
- Define the data models based on Steam’s API responses (e.g., User, Game, GameCategory).
- Sketch initial wireframes for the user interface, focusing on login flow and basic layout.

### Day 3: Authentication
- Implement OAuth for Steam login.
- Set up a secure method for handling authentication tokens.
- Test the login flow to ensure that user data can be securely accessed.

### Day 4: Fetching Data
- Implement functionality to fetch user profile data from Steam (nickname, avatar).
- Begin working on fetching the user’s game library.

### Day 5: Data Storage
- Set up a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) to store user data and game data.
- Implement models and database integration in the backend.

## Week 2: Feature Development and Initial Deployment

### Day 6: Display User Data
- Create front-end components to display user profile data.
- Start integrating the game library data into the frontend.

### Day 7: Game Library Visualization
- Develop components to visually represent the game library (e.g., grid view of game posters).
- Implement filters for sorting and categorizing games by various parameters.

### Day 8: Game Categorization
- Write a function to categorize games based on their tags into predefined categories (e.g., Shooting, Adventure).
- Implement backend logic to count games by category and other statistics like total disk space used.

### Day 9: Data Visualization
- Implement charts to display game statistics over time, such as the number of games per category and playtime trends.
- Use a charting library like Chart.js or D3.js to create dynamic, interactive charts.

### Day 10: User Interaction
- Allow users to rate games and modify the display of the game library based on user preferences (e.g., sort by rating, date added).
- Ensure all user inputs are validated both client-side and server-side.

## Final Steps: Testing and Review

### Day 11: Integration Testing
- Conduct thorough testing of all components together to ensure they work seamlessly.
- Test for bugs in the user interface and data processing.

### Day 12: Performance Optimization
- Analyze and optimize the performance of the application.
- Optimize database queries and server response times.

### Day 13: Deployment
- Prepare the application for deployment.
- Deploy to a secure and scalable environment (e.g., AWS, Heroku).

### Day 14: Documentation and Cleanup
- Write documentation covering setup, usage, and any important functions.
- Review code for cleanliness and remove any unnecessary parts.
