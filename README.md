### [DevelopPlan](developPlan.md) for two weeks.
  
## Introduction
This project is designed to enhance the gaming experience for Steam users by creating a dynamic web application that integrates with Steam's API. Our aim is to provide a personalized dashboard where users can log in with their Steam accounts and access a wealth of information about their gaming library. Key features of the application include displaying user profiles, categorizing games into genres like shooting, adventure, simulation, and casual games, and offering detailed statistics on game usage, such as total playtime and storage requirements.

Through this platform, users will also be able to rate games, view changes in their gaming habits over time, and customize the display of their game libraries through various sorting options. The project will leverage modern web technologies to ensure a responsive, intuitive interface that enhances user engagement and provides valuable insights into their gaming trends.

This two-week sprint will focus on setting up the project infrastructure, integrating with the Steam API, developing key features, and preparing for a preliminary deployment. Our goal is to create a robust application that not only meets the functional requirements but also delivers a seamless and enjoyable user experience.
